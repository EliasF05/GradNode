# JNN: Basic Deep-Learning Framework in Java

## Description
JNN is a very basic deep learning framework in Java that makes use of GradNode to implement Layer and Neural Network Classes. 

## Why?
1. Personal Project to prove my understanding of basic linear Neural Networks to myself
2. Who knows when being able to implement Machine Learning Models might come in handy
