# GradNode: Basic AutoGrad Engine in Java

## Description
Use GradNode, GradVec, GradMat and GradPriz objects to perform arithmetic and algebraic operations while Gradients are being kept track of.<br>This can be used to implement
Machine Learning Models and other Procedures based on Gradient Calculation.

## Check out the Branch 'JNN' for a basic implementation of Linear Neural Networks using this Framework
