# JNN: Basic Deep-Learning Framework in Java

## Description
JNN is a very basic deep learning framework in Java that makes use of GradNode to implement Layer and Neural Network Classes. 

## Why?
1. Personal Project to prove my understanding of basic linear Neural Networks to myself
2. Who knows when being able to implement Machine Learning Models in Java might come in handy
3. I was taught Java at University and wanted to create a Data Science Project using it
